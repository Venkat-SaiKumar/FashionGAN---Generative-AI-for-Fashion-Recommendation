# FashionGAN---Generative-AI-for-Fashion-Recommendation
In this project, I have developed a Generative AI model for fashion recommendation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The model is trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset to generate realistic clothing images, enabling personalized fashion suggestions.

*Key Sections & Content
 
1)Importing Dependencies
Installs necessary libraries (tensorflow, tensorflow-datasets, matplotlib, ipywidgets).
Configures TensorFlow for GPU usage (if available).
Loads the Fashion MNIST dataset using tensorflow_datasets.

2)Data Visualization & Preprocessing
Uses matplotlib to visualize sample images from the dataset.
Converts images into a format suitable for training.

3)Building the GAN Model
Constructs the Generator and Discriminator models using TensorFlow/Keras.
Defines the loss functions and optimizers for training.

4)Training the GAN
Implements the training loop where the generator learns to create realistic fashion images.
Tracks training progress using loss curves and image generation at intervals.

5)Generating New Fashion Images
After training, the model generates new clothing designs based on learned patterns.
